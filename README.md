# Biologically-inferred topoclimate

This repository contains data and R and Stan code for the paper *MM Kling, KC Baer, and DD Ackerly. Plants as microclimate indicators: reverse engineering the climatic effects of fine-scale topography from tree species distributions (currently in review).*

For the associated R package that enables users to generate biologically-inferred microclimate maps using the results of this analysis, see the [topoclimate.pred](https://github.com/matthewkling/topoclimate.pred) repository.
