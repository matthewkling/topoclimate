# Biologically-inferred topoclimate

This repository contains data and R and Stan code for the paper by MM Kling, KC Baer, and DD Ackerly, currently in review.

For the associated R package that enables users to generate biologically-inferred microclimate maps using the results of this analysis, see the [topoclimate.pred](https://github.com/matthewkling/topoclimate.pred) repository.
